# BACKEND STANDARDS

Guidance for the Python backend (`backend/`): the FastAPI app, Celery workers, database, and
tests. Additive to the root `AGENTS.md`.

## Key Rules

- Use explicit validation in application code. Reserve `assert` for tests.
- Declare owned protocol implementations through explicit inheritance.

- Put ALL db operations under the `backend/onyx/db` / `backend/ee/onyx/db` directories. Don't run
  queries outside of those directories. Exception: `backend/onyx/cache/postgres_backend.py` is the
  PostgreSQL implementation of `CacheBackend`, so its queries belong there.
- When creating new FastAPI APIs, do NOT use the `response_model` field. Instead, just type the
  function.
- OpenSearch is the current document index backend for search and indexing. Some legacy modules,
  Celery task names, and migration helpers still mention Vespa; treat those as compatibility or
  migration artifacts unless the active `DocumentIndex` factory/config path explicitly uses them.
- Do not use `getattr`: it hides attribute access from the type checker. Use
  plain attribute access when the name is statically known. A genuinely dynamic
  lookup needs an `# ods: ignore[getattr]` comment with a brief justification
  (checked by `ods check-getattr`).

## Background Workers (Celery)

Onyx uses Celery for asynchronous task processing. Worker apps live in
`backend/onyx/background/celery/apps/`; the periodic schedule is defined in
`backend/onyx/background/celery/tasks/beat_schedule.py`.

| Worker | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `primary` | Coordinates core background tasks: connector management/deletion, document-index sync, pruning checks, LLM model updates, user file sync |
| `docfetching` | Fetches documents from connectors, spawns docprocessing tasks; watchdog for stuck connectors |
| `docprocessing` | Indexing pipeline: upsert docs to Postgres, chunk, embed via model server, write chunks to the document index, update metadata |
| `light` | Fast lightweight ops: metadata sync, permissions upsert, checkpoint / index-attempt cleanup |
| `heavy` | Resource-intensive ops: pruning, document permissions sync, external group sync, CSV generation |
| `monitoring` | System health monitoring & metrics collection |
| `user_file_processing` | User-uploaded file indexing & project synchronization |
| `scheduled_tasks` | Executes user-scheduled (Craft) task runs |
| `beat` | Scheduler for periodic tasks; uses `DynamicTenantScheduler` for multi-tenant support |

Key facts:

- All workers use thread pools (not processes) — this is why Celery time limits don't work (see below).
- Multi-tenant: `DynamicTenantScheduler` explicitly adds `tenant_id` to each Celery Beat task's
  kwargs; direct task sends must propagate it themselves (`TenantAwareTask` silently falls back to
  the default schema when it's absent).
- Tasks route to named queues and carry a separate High/Medium/Low priority (`OnyxCeleryQueues` /
  `OnyxCeleryPriority` in `backend/onyx/configs/constants.py`); Redis coordinates inter-process
  communication; task state and metadata live in PostgreSQL.

### Defining Tasks

- Always use `@shared_task` rather than `@celery_app`
- Put tasks under `background/celery/tasks/` or `ee/background/celery/tasks`
- Never enqueue a task without an expiration. Always supply `expires=` when
  sending tasks, either from the beat schedule or directly from another task. It
  should never be acceptable to submit code which enqueues tasks without an
  expiration, as doing so can lead to unbounded task queue growth.

### Task Time Limits

Since all tasks are executed in thread pools, the time limit features of Celery are silently
disabled and won't work. Timeout logic must be implemented within the task itself.

### Testing Worker Changes

If you make any updates to a celery worker and you want to test these changes, you will need
to ask the user to restart the celery worker. There is no auto-restart on code-change mechanism.

## Database & Migrations

Run all `alembic` commands from `backend/` (where `alembic.ini` lives) through `uv run`.

### Running Migrations

```bash
# Standard migrations
uv run alembic upgrade head

# Multi-tenant (Enterprise)
uv run alembic -n schema_private upgrade head
```

### Creating Migrations

```bash
# Create migration
uv run alembic revision -m "description"

# Multi-tenant migration
uv run alembic -n schema_private revision -m "description"
```

Write the migration manually and place it in the file that alembic creates when running the above command.

## Testing Strategy

Run pytest through `uv run` from the repo root — no venv activation needed (`uv run` uses the
lockfile-pinned environment and creates/syncs `.venv` as needed).

There are 4 main types of tests within Onyx:

### Model choice for tests that make real LLM calls

When a test makes a real LLM call (e.g. External Dependency Unit / integration tests
that hit a live provider), use the cheap-and-fast tier for each provider:

- **OpenAI**: `gpt-5-mini` (never `gpt-4o` / `gpt-4o-mini`)
- **Anthropic**: `claude-haiku-4-5`

### Unit Tests

These should not assume any Onyx/external services are available to be called.
Interactions with the outside world should be mocked using `unittest.mock`. Generally, only
write these for complex, isolated modules e.g. `citation_processing.py`.

To run them:

```bash
uv run pytest -xv backend/tests/unit
```

### External Dependency Unit Tests

These tests assume that all external dependencies of Onyx are available and callable (e.g. Postgres, Redis,
MinIO/S3, OpenSearch are running + OpenAI can be called + any request to the internet is fine + etc.).

However, the actual Onyx containers are not running and with these tests we call the function to test directly.
We can also mock components/calls at will.

The goal with these tests are to minimize mocking while giving some flexibility to mock things that are flakey,
need strictly controlled behavior, or need to have their internal behavior validated (e.g. verify a function is called
with certain args, something that would be impossible with proper integration tests).

A great example of this type of test is `backend/tests/external_dependency_unit/connectors/confluence/test_confluence_group_sync.py`.

To run them:

```bash
uv run --env-file .vscode/.env pytest backend/tests/external_dependency_unit
```

### Integration Tests

Standard integration tests. Every test in `backend/tests/integration` runs against a real Onyx deployment. We cannot
mock anything in these tests. Prefer writing integration tests (or External Dependency Unit Tests if mocking/internal
verification is necessary) over any other type of test.

Tests are parallelized at a directory level.

When writing integration tests, make sure to check the root `conftest.py` for useful fixtures + the `backend/tests/integration/common_utils` directory for utilities. Prefer (if one exists), calling the appropriate Manager
class in the utils over directly calling the APIs with a library like `requests`. Prefer using fixtures rather than
calling the utilities directly (e.g. do NOT create admin users with
`admin_user = UserManager.create(name="admin_user")`, instead use the `admin_user` fixture).

A great example of this type of test is `backend/tests/integration/tests/streaming_endpoints/test_chat_stream.py`.

To run them:

```bash
uv run --env-file .vscode/.env pytest backend/tests/integration
```

### Playwright (E2E) Tests

These tests are an even more complete version of the Integration Tests mentioned above. Has all services of Onyx
running, _including_ the Web Server.

Use these tests for anything that requires significant frontend <-> backend coordination.

Tests are located at `web/tests/e2e`. Tests are written in TypeScript. Spec-writing rules
(Page Object Model, locator priority) live in `web/tests/e2e/README.md`.

To run them (the `playwright` script expands to `playwright test`; use it rather than
`bunx`/`npx`, which can silently fetch an unpinned Playwright version):

```bash
cd web && bun run playwright <TEST_NAME>
```

For shared fixtures, best practices, and detailed guidance, see `backend/tests/README.md`.

## Error Handling

**Always raise `OnyxError` from `onyx.error_handling.exceptions` instead of `HTTPException`.
Never hardcode status codes or use `starlette.status` / `fastapi.status` constants directly.**

A global FastAPI exception handler converts `OnyxError` into a JSON response with the standard
`{"error_code": "...", "detail": "..."}` shape. This eliminates boilerplate and keeps error
handling consistent across the entire backend.

```python
from onyx.error_handling.error_codes import OnyxErrorCode
from onyx.error_handling.exceptions import OnyxError

# ✅ Good
raise OnyxError(OnyxErrorCode.NOT_FOUND, "Session not found")

# ✅ Good — no extra message needed
raise OnyxError(OnyxErrorCode.UNAUTHENTICATED)

# ✅ Good — upstream service with dynamic status code
raise OnyxError(OnyxErrorCode.BAD_GATEWAY, detail, status_code_override=upstream_status)

# ❌ Bad — using HTTPException directly
raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Session not found")

# ❌ Bad — starlette constant
raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Access denied")
```

Available error codes are defined in `backend/onyx/error_handling/error_codes.py`. If a new error
category is needed, add it there first — do not invent ad-hoc codes.

**Upstream service errors:** When forwarding errors from an upstream service where the HTTP
status code is dynamic (comes from the upstream response), use `status_code_override`:

```python
raise OnyxError(
    OnyxErrorCode.BAD_GATEWAY, detail, status_code_override=e.response.status_code
)
```

## AI/LLM Integration

Text generation uses `LLM` with `GenerationRequest` and `GenerationContext`.
The LiteLLM adapter implements the client. Models remain configurable per feature.

### Tracing — every LLM invocation must be tagged

Every LLM, embedding, rerank, image-generation, voice (STT/TTS), and intent-classification call must open a generation span tagged with a value from the `LLMFlow` registry in `backend/onyx/tracing/flows.py`. Use one of:

- `GenerationContext(flow=LLMFlow.X)` for shared client calls. The client owns the generation span.
- `llm_generation_span(llm_info=llm.info, flow=LLMFlow.X, input_messages=...)` for raw provider operations in protocol gateways. `llm_info` is an `LLMInfo` value.
- `traced_llm_call(flow=LLMFlow.X, model=..., provider=..., input_messages=...)` for direct provider SDK / `litellm` / model_server HTTP calls that bypass the `LLM` abstraction.

Rules:

1. Add a new `LLMFlow` enum value before instrumenting a new operation. Don't pass raw strings.
2. Flow tags name the **operation** (e.g. `IMAGE_EDIT`, `RERANK`) — not the provider. Provider lives in `model_config["model_provider"]`.
3. Shared calls without a flow emit `LLMFlow.UNTAGGED_INVOKE` or `UNTAGGED_STREAM`. These sentinels indicate missing instrumentation. Fix the call site.
