"""Tests for the operator-forced document-set scope in OpenSearch query construction.

The forced scope (from FORCED_DOCUMENT_SET_NAMES) must be applied as a STANDALONE
top-level AND filter clause — distinct from the user/persona ``document_set`` scope,
which lives inside the OR-based knowledge filter. This is what makes the forced scope
INTERSECT with (restrict), rather than widen, any existing scope, while leaving ACL
enforcement intact.
