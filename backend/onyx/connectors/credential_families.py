"""Credential families: one account shared by related sources.

A family credential is stored in the family's shape (a ``FamilyCredential``
model) plus a ``CREDENTIAL_FAMILY_KEY`` marker. Each member source has a
``FamilyCredentialCodec`` that converts between the family shape and the
source's own keys, so connectors keep reading their own keys. Credentials
created before their source joined a family keep their source's shape and stay
usable by that source only.
