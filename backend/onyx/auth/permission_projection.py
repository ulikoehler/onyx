"""Read-side capability projection.

Stamps a ``permissions`` map on resource DTOs from the same decision the write guards
enforce, so the client can hide controls the user would be 403'd on.

These maps are affordance hints only, never an authz input: every mutating route keeps
its own guard as the security boundary. Fail-closed — a key absent from the map reads
as ``False`` on the client.
